# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

The primary purpose of this software is to aide in the administrative requirements of running a small automotive repair facility. Specifically this software will focus on; quotations, invoices, customer, vehicle, and parts data, service menus, and third party account software output files.

Principally this software will allow the users to focus on their revenue creating tasks by simplifying administrative and record keeping tasks. Many of the automotive software suites available today are either specialized and constricting or too open ended. The intended goal of this project is to strike a balance. This program will keep the user filling out simple forms with very easy to understand CRUD type operations and allow for the most basic and useful forms of customization, such as service menu item creation.

## 1.2 Intended Audience

This system is being developed for a specific client in mind; as such the intended audience will be crafted with their specific needs in mind. At the moment of writing the client is an owner operated automotive/general machine mobile repair service provider with a home garage in the Harrison County (Gulfport-Biloxi) area in Mississippi. The primary user will be the owner-operator and the controller.
